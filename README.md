# Loan Default Prediction 🏦📉

A machine learning project that predicts whether a loan application will be approved, using structured tabular data and tree-based models.

## 🔍 Overview

This project solves a real-world classification problem from the [Loan Prediction Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset). We use Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict loan approval outcomes based on features like income, loan amount, credit history, and more.
